Stage 1
The core functionality consists of three screens.

Part 1
A home page that should be visible without logging in. This should display all the books that are for sale. For each book the following should be shown:

1. The name of the book
2. The name of the author
3. A thumbnail image
4. A price

Part 2
Clicking on either the thumbnail or name should load a product details page that shows:

1. The name of the book
2. A full resolution image
3. The price
4. A detailed, multi-line, formatted description taken from the endleaf.
5. The EAN (barcode) number.

If the customer is logged in they should also see a link or button to add the item to their shopping cart.
